# ETG-ML-AI-Internship
This repository contains the projects I have done in the internship


First I have created the inventory system of 30 different mobiles with the properties of name,color,RAM ,ROM,Rating,Quantity .
Next I have purchased a new item and updated the inventory. (id 1031)

In the another file I have sold a mobile to customer and updated the inventory and saved it.


Thank you,
